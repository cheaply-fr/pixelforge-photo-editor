# Roadmap progress rubric

This rubric keeps implementation, verification, deployment, and live acceptance separate. A capability earns weighted credit only when its UI/data model and required tests are present; a release gate remains incomplete until protected CI, the deployed revision, and live behavior are independently verified.

## Weights

| Stage | Weight | Completion evidence |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Document model and persistence | 18% | Editable raster/text/vector layers, groups, masks, versioned migration, corruption and round-trip tests |
| Selection and precision geometry | 14% | Rectangle/ellipse/row/column/lasso/color selection, alpha algebra, feather/refinement, transforms and cancellation tests |
| Painting and retouching | 14% | Brush/eraser/fill/gradient/clone/healing settings, source safety, pressure fallback, pixel fixtures and touch tests |
| Typography and vectors | 10% | Text layout and spacing, parametric shapes, paths, transforms, editable export and mobile/desktop coverage |
| Adjustments and filters | 14% | Distinct nondestructive algorithms, representative pixels, metadata persistence, lock/undo and browser coverage |
| History, projects and exports | 12% | Recovery/migration/conflict handling, private authorization, PNG/JPEG/WebP quality/size/privacy and cancellable batch tests |
| Accessibility, mobile and scale | 10% | Keyboard and assistive semantics, physical mobile checks, offline recovery, worker/tile cancellation and measured budgets |
| Interoperability and optional intelligence | 8% | Explicit HEIC/PSD/RAW/TIFF/SVG/PDF labels, background/object cleanup contracts, privacy/resource/error gates |
| **Total** | **100%** | **All stage evidence is required for completion** |

## Status rules

- **Implemented locally** means source, data model, pure tests and relevant desktop/mobile tests exist. It does not imply CI, deployment or live acceptance.
- **CI verified** means the protected workflow completed successfully for the exact candidate SHA. Static analysis or a separate code-scanning workflow is not sufficient.
- **Deployed** means the production workflow published the tested artifact and its verification step passed for the exact SHA.
- **Live accepted** means `/release.json`, readiness, DNS/TLS, editor behavior, representative export pixels, and applicable account/project authorization all match the deployed SHA.
- A stage is **verified shipped** only when all applicable evidence is present. Approximation, aliases, disabled menu entries, and source-only changes remain partial.

## Current baseline

The repository contains broad partial implementations across all eight stages. The last locally recorded toolbar milestone had 658 passing unit tests and 18/18 focused desktop/mobile toolbar tests. Protected run `38386650794` completed successfully for `7495c1b4…`, including its production deploy. Independent live checks then matched that SHA in `/release.json` and `/api/readyz.json`; DNS resolves through `photoeditor-cheaply.web.app` to `199.36.158.100`, TLS verifies for `photoeditor.cheaply.fr`, the editor reports `v0.1.0 · Server online · 7495c1b4…`, and the export dialog confirmed a downloaded 102,221-byte JPEG with metadata privacy disclosure. PR #136 remains a separate, unmerged documentation change.

Progress percentages in status reports are estimates derived from this rubric and must identify the stage evidence that is still missing. They must never be increased solely because source files changed.

## Latest local increment

The inspector now exposes a History timeline backed by the existing bounded
immutable frame stack. It provides keyboard-addressable summaries and direct
restore navigation without a second document model; the restore path retains
the existing branch semantics and local conflict protections. Pure coverage is
in `tests/history-timeline.test.mjs`, and desktop/mobile acceptance coverage is
in `tests/browser/history-panel.spec.ts`. This increment is locally verified;
it is not CI, deployment or live acceptance until a protected workflow runs for
the candidate SHA.

The brush-family controls also include a persisted, bounded smoothing amount
for Brush, Pencil and Eraser. `src/brushSmoothing.ts` keeps pointer response
deterministic and source-safe, with pure coverage in
`tests/brush-smoothing.test.mjs`; details and limitations are recorded in
`docs/brush-smoothing-contract.md`. This remains local evidence until the
protected workflow and live candidate verification pass.
