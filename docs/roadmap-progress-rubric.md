# Roadmap progress rubric

This rubric keeps implementation, verification, deployment, and live acceptance separate. A capability earns weighted credit only when its UI/data model and required tests are present; a release gate remains incomplete until protected CI, the deployed revision, and live behavior are independently verified.

## Weights

| Stage | Weight | Completion evidence |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Document model and persistence | 18% | Editable raster/text/vector layers, groups, masks, versioned migration, corruption and round-trip tests |
| Selection and precision geometry | 14% | Rectangle/ellipse/row/column/lasso/color selection, alpha algebra, feather/refinement, transforms and cancellation tests |
| Painting and retouching | 14% | Brush/eraser/fill/gradient/clone/healing settings, source safety, pressure fallback, pixel fixtures and touch tests |
| Typography and vectors | 10% | Text layout and spacing, bounded editable Warp Text, parametric shapes, paths, transforms, editable export and mobile/desktop coverage |
| Adjustments and filters | 14% | Distinct nondestructive algorithms, representative pixels, metadata persistence, lock/undo and browser coverage |
| History, projects and exports | 12% | Recovery/migration/conflict handling, private authorization, PNG/JPEG/WebP quality/size/privacy and cancellable batch tests |
| Accessibility, mobile and scale | 10% | Keyboard and assistive semantics, physical mobile checks, offline recovery, worker/tile cancellation and measured budgets |
| Interoperability and optional intelligence | 8% | Explicit HEIC/PSD/RAW/TIFF/SVG/PDF labels, background/object cleanup contracts, privacy/resource/error gates |
| **Total** | **100%** | **All stage evidence is required for completion** |

## Status rules

- **Implemented locally** means source, data model, pure tests and relevant desktop/mobile tests exist. It does not imply CI, deployment or live acceptance.
- **CI verified** means the protected workflow completed successfully for the exact candidate SHA. Static analysis or a separate code-scanning workflow is not sufficient.
- **Deployed** means the production workflow published the tested artifact and its verification step passed for the exact SHA.
- **Live accepted** means `/release.json`, readiness, DNS/TLS, editor behavior, representative export pixels, and applicable account/project authorization all match the deployed SHA.
- A stage is **verified shipped** only when all applicable evidence is present. Approximation, aliases, disabled menu entries, and source-only changes remain partial.

## Current baseline

The repository contains broad partial implementations across all eight stages. The last locally recorded toolbar milestone had 668 passing unit tests and 18/18 focused desktop/mobile toolbar tests. Protected run `38386650794` completed successfully for `7495c1b4…`, including its production deploy. Independent live checks then matched that SHA in `/release.json` and `/api/readyz.json`; DNS resolves through `photoeditor-cheaply.web.app` to `199.36.158.100`, TLS verifies for `photoeditor.cheaply.fr`, the editor reports `v0.1.0 · Server online · 7495c1b4…`, and the export dialog confirmed a downloaded 102,221-byte JPEG with metadata privacy disclosure. PR #136 remains a separate, unmerged documentation change. Newer gradient endpoint and midpoint work is locally validated on the roadmap branch but is not represented by that deployed baseline.

Progress percentages in status reports are estimates derived from this rubric and must identify the stage evidence that is still missing. They must never be increased solely because source files changed.

The bounded local Content-Aware Move slice is available through `Edit →
Content-Aware Move…`. It requires an explicit selection, fills the vacated
region from deterministic local context, translates the selected pixels and
commits a new undoable asset; semantic object removal and generative inference
remain outside this contract. Pure and desktop/mobile acceptance are recorded
in `docs/content-aware-move-contract.md`.

## Latest local increment

The inspector now exposes a History timeline backed by the existing bounded
immutable frame stack. It provides keyboard-addressable summaries and direct
restore navigation without a second document model; the restore path retains
the existing branch semantics and local conflict protections. Pure coverage is
in `tests/history-timeline.test.mjs`, and desktop/mobile acceptance coverage is
in `tests/browser/history-panel.spec.ts`. This increment is locally verified;
it is not CI, deployment or live acceptance until a protected workflow runs for
the candidate SHA.

The brush-family controls also include a persisted, bounded smoothing amount
for Brush, Pencil and Eraser. `src/brushSmoothing.ts` keeps pointer response
deterministic and source-safe, with pure coverage in
`tests/brush-smoothing.test.mjs`; details and limitations are recorded in
`docs/brush-smoothing-contract.md`. This remains local evidence until the
protected workflow and live candidate verification pass.

Brush-family controls now also include a persisted, bounded deterministic
Scatter amount. `src/brushDynamics.ts` derives a replay-stable bounded stamp
offset without global randomness; pure coverage is in
`tests/brush-dynamics.test.mjs`, with desktop/mobile project-file coverage in
`tests/browser/brush-dynamics.spec.ts`. Texture, dual-brush, bristle and
wet-media dynamics remain staged.

Brush-family controls now also include a persisted deterministic Texture
amount. It modulates each local stamp's opacity with a bounded position-derived
factor while preserving the zero-value path and source-safe commit boundary.
Pure coverage is in `tests/brush-texture.test.mjs`, browser persistence coverage
is in `tests/browser/brush-texture.spec.ts`, and limitations are documented in
`docs/brush-texture-contract.md`.

Brush-family controls now also include a persisted deterministic Dual brush
amount. It applies a bounded secondary opacity weave to each local stamp while
preserving the zero-value path and source-safe commit boundary. Pure coverage is
in `tests/brush-dual.test.mjs`, with desktop/mobile project-file coverage in
`tests/browser/brush-dynamics.spec.ts`; full wet-media simulation remains staged; bounded wet colour pickup and physical bristle filament coverage and the optional secondary preset tip are active.

Brush-family controls now also include a persisted deterministic Bristle amount.
It applies bounded filament-like opacity modulation to each local stamp while
preserving the zero-value path and source-safe commit boundary. Pure coverage is
in `tests/brush-bristle.test.mjs`, with the same desktop/mobile project-file
acceptance; full wet-media simulation remains staged; bounded wet colour pickup and physical bristle filament coverage is active.

Brush-family controls also include a persisted Flow amount that scales local
dab opacity independently from overall Opacity. `tests/browser/brush-flow.spec.ts`
covers the accessible control and project-file round-trip; the setting defaults
to 100% for legacy drafts and is documented in `docs/brush-flow-contract.md`.

The Gradient tool now exposes persisted Linear and Radial geometry. Radial
mode uses the drag start as its centre and drag distance as its radius while
retaining source-safe undoable commits. Desktop/mobile UI, pixel-change,
reload and project-file coverage is in
`tests/browser/gradient-modes.spec.ts`; limitations are recorded in
`docs/gradient-mode-contract.md`.

Gradient geometry now also includes Reflected mode, with colour at both ends
and a transparent midpoint on the authored linear axis. Up to six ordered
interior gradient stops are now authored for Linear and Radial modes; the legacy
midpoint control remains the fallback when no stop list is present. Noise and
gradient-map behaviour remain staged. The persisted Gradient end control can use
either the transparent default or the current background colour, including for
the reflected midpoint. An optional persisted authored midpoint colour now adds
a deterministic third stop. A bounded deterministic Dither control is also
persisted and tested for nontransparent gradient pixels, with a configurable
1%-99% midpoint position; a bounded deterministic RGB Noise control now adds
independent opaque-pixel variation while preserving alpha and transparent RGB;
a persisted Reverse control swaps Linear/Radial start
and end colours while preserving Reflected symmetry.
